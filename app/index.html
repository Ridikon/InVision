                  Business owners have to wear many hats. Although they can hire
                  as many employees as needed, they have to find time to
                  personally communicate issues with partners. In this case, an
                  individual email signature is a must. If the business owner
                  provides complete information such as personal contacts, links
                  to social networks, photo and more in email correspondence, it
                  says much about their high professionalism and sociability.

                  why it is important to use all possible tools for better
                  communication and one of them is an email signature. Create
